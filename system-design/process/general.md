# General

## Tips

- Don't dive in `too quickly` or get to `arrogant`.
- Ask `clarifying questions` when unsure about a requirement or assumption.
- `Break the problem down`into smaller more manageable components. Estimate these components separately, then aggregate the estimations.
- Draw from `prior experience`.
- Don't get married to one idea. Be prepared to `adjust` and `revise` your estimations when new knowledge comes to light.
- Don't be afraid to discuss `trade-offs`. Explain why you choose one approach over the other.

### Keep numbers simple

- Utilize basic arithmetic to estimate the scale of data and resources
- Use round numbers to make calculations easier and faster.
