# General Notes

## Collation

Collations are a set of rules that decide how characters compare to each other. A set of rules.

The default in mysql is `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`.

- `utf8mb4`: name of the character set
- `0900`: unicode weights
- `ai`: accent insensitive (Ã  == a)
- `ci`: character insensitive (A == a)
